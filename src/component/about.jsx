        Hi, I’m a web developer and beginner UI designer who’s passionate about
        building user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. My
        journey started with <span>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>, and I’ve
        recently expanded into frameworks like <span>React.</span> I enjoy
        solving real-world problems through code and experimenting with modern
        design trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I’ve built projects like a{" "}
        <span>
          weather app, social media post, todo app and a recipe finder
        </span>{" "}
        , which have helped me strengthen my skills in dynamic functionality and
        responsive design.Currently, I’m working on creating my personal
        portfolio to showcase my progress and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to grow as a front-end developer, mastering React and UI
        design, and eventually contributing to impactful projects that make a
        difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I challenge myself physically and mentally through
        outdoor running and evening <span>calisthenics</span>, which keep me
        focused and energized.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m excited to share my journey, connect with other developers, and
        explore collaboration opportunities. Check out my projects or drop me a
        message—I’d love to hear from you!
